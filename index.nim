        Netelip was my first home, I had my intership there after I finished my latest studies, after 3 months of 
        intership I stayed there working, in total I spent there 1 year. My first job was to make a complex platform
        to work, it was developed in symfony, but it was unusable due to the high latency (up to 5s to do any action)
        in the frontend, the first thing I did was update to PHP7, just with that, it became much more responsive.
